# random.writer
This is a C++ program that uses a doubly-linked list data structure to model an input text.
The program reads in the text from any given book. It then picks a seed of any constant length, which is any symbol that appears 
in the text depending on its frequency. The seed changes every iteration depending on a characterâ€™s frequency in the text. In the end,
the program is able to assemble a file that resembles the orginal text because it is made up of symbols that model their occurrences
in the orginal.
